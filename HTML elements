        <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost
        every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because
        paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization
        of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>

    <p id-"para">Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. Originally
    created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming language, the first public beta build was released on 17
    May 2009. The game would be continuously developed from then on, receiving a full release on 18 November 2011.
    Afterwards, Persson left Mojang and gave Jens "Jeb" Bergensten control over development. In the years since its release,
    it has been ported to several platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and various video game consoles. In 2014,
    Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Minecraft is the
    best-selling video game of all-time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly active players as
    of 2024.</p>

    <h2>Extinction & Fascinating Facts</h2>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>ü¶ñ Dinosaurs dominated Earth for over <strong>160 million years</strong>, evolving into a wide variety of
            species‚Äîfrom towering giants to feathered flyers. But around <strong>66 million years ago</strong>, their
            reign came to a sudden end.</p>

        <p>üåç Scientists believe this mass extinction was triggered by a combination of catastrophic events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asteroid Impact:</strong> A massive asteroid struck near present-day Mexico, forming the
                Chicxulub crater and releasing immense energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Eruptions:</strong> The Deccan Traps in India spewed lava and gases, disrupting the
                climate.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Collapse:</strong> Dust and debris blocked sunlight, cooling the planet and collapsing
                ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>üå± While most dinosaurs vanished, some small feathered species survived and evolved into <strong>modern
                birds</strong>. So in a way, dinosaurs still live among us!</p>

        <h3>üß† Fun Dinosaur Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not all dinosaurs were huge!</strong> Microraptor was smaller than a chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Many dinosaurs had feathers!</strong> Especially those closely related to birds.</li>
            <li><strong>Dinosaurs lived on every continent!</strong> Fossils have been found worldwide‚Äîeven Antarctica.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Birds are living dinosaurs!</strong> They evolved from theropods like Velociraptor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>these is somthing that may get your fears of! remember: dinosaurs came in all shapes and
            sizes‚Äîfrom venomous to feathered, from towering giants to tiny sprinters. Their reign spanned over 160
            million years, ending with the dramatic Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. While the exact cause is
            still debated, evidence points to a massive asteroid impact and volcanic activity that reshaped Earth‚Äôs
            environment.</p>
